# Pharmacy Rust Smart Contract

## Getting started
## About
This is a project on the sales of drugs at a pharmacy. It seeks to manage the stocks as the sales occur.

To get started with this template:

1. Click the "Use this template" button to create a new repo based on this template
2. Update line 2 of `Cargo.toml` with your project name
3. Update line 4 of `Cargo.toml` with your project author names
4. Set up the [prerequisites](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs#pre-requisites)
5. Begin writing your smart contract in `src/lib.rs`
6. Test the contract 

    `cargo test -- --nocapture`

8. Build the contract

    `RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release`

## Tools for development
## Rust
If youâ€™re a Windows Subsystem for Linux user run the following in your terminal, then follow the on-screen instructions to install Rust.
To get started with this template:

    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Then checking version :

    rustc --version
## Node and Npm

In a web browser, navigate to https://nodejs.org/en/download/. The Node.js installer includes the NPM package manager.
Then for verification of installation run , Open a command prompt (or PowerShell), and enter the following:

    node -v
    npm -v

## Near Cli
Installation
Make sure you have a current version of npm and NodeJS installed.

### **Mac and Linux**
1.Install npm and node using a package manager like nvm as sometimes there are issues using Ledger due to how OS X handles node packages related to USB devices. [click here]
2.Ensure you have installed Node version 12 or above.
Install near-cli globally by running:

    npm install -g near-cli

### **Windows**
For Windows users, we recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

1.Install WSL [click here]
2.Install npm [click here]
3.Install Node.js [ click here ]
4.Change npm default directory [ click here ]
This is to avoid any permission issues with WSL
5.Open WSL and install near-cli globally by running:

    npm install -g near-cli

# Summary of the Code 
 ## Dependancies 
    Initialization for dependancies with Borsh being the recommended serialization method for near smart contract development.
 ## product Struct
    Contains the property of a product. That holds on details of the product

## sales Struct 

    Contains the property of a sale. That holds on details of the sale
 ## Pharmacy Struct
    Contains the Property of the pharmacy. Holds the instances of the sale of specific products as vectors at the pharmacy
 
 ## Implementation of my App 
  Inside involves the following state operations :
  
  1. Function to add the drug as the product in the inventory
  2. Every product has specific properties such as name, cost and quantity
  3. Function for a specific instance of sale of a drug.
  4. There is an item and the quantity of the item during each sale.
  4. Function to add retrun an answer to a client asking for an unavailable drug quantity

## Tests
For the Smart contract using the Command :

    Cargo test
    or
    Cargo test -- --nocapture
Test to confirm of sucess of my Contract
//## Build the contract

    `RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release`
